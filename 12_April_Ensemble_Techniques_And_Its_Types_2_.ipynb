        "###Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is a machine learning ensemble technique used to reduce overfitting by combining multiple models trained on different subsets of the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "###In decision tree bagging, instead of training a single decision tree on the entire training dataset, multiple decision trees are trained on different subsets of the data. These subsets are created by sampling the training data with replacement, which is known as bootstrapping.\n",
        "\n",
        "###By using bootstrapping, each tree is trained on a slightly different set of data, which means that each tree will have a different structure and different predictions. However, when the predictions of all the trees are combined, the ensemble model will provide more robust predictions than any individual tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "###The process of combining the predictions of multiple decision trees is known as aggregation. In bagging, aggregation is typically done by taking the average or majority vote of the predictions of all the trees. This helps to reduce the variance in the predictions and, hence, reduces overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Overall, bagging helps reduce overfitting in decision trees by introducing randomness in the data used to train the individual trees, and then aggregating their predictions to produce a more robust ensemble model."
